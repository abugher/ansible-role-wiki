This role is incomplete.  It will not deploy a working installation.  

If you comment out the lines for LocalSettings.php, remove that file from the target, deploy the role, then browse the wiki URL, you should be prompted for setup steps, including setting the password for an admin user.  It will also give you a new LocalSettings.php file, which may be redundant to the one provided here.  If you are restoring an old installation, you should be able to skip the setup steps, but you will need to restore the database from a backup, instead.  After that, uncomment the lines for LocalSettings.php and deploy again.
